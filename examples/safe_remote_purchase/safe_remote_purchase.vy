#Safe Remote Purchase
#Originally from

#ported to vyper and optimized

#Rundown of the transaction:
#1. Seller posts item for sale and posts safety deposit of double the item value.
# Balance is 2*value.
#(1.1. Seller can reclaim deposit and close the sale as long as nothing was purchased.)
#2. Buyer purchases item (value) plus posts an additional safety deposit (Item value).
# Balance is 4*value.
#3. Seller ships item.
#4. Buyer confirms receiving the item. Buyer's deposit (value) is returned.
#Seller's deposit (2*value) + items value is returned. Balance is 0.
